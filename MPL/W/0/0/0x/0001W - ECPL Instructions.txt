To create a new Entry:
  1) Browse to the category folder and run 'new.bat' which calls 'new.py' and launches the new text file in the default editor
  2) Add documents and datasheets to the containing folder
  8) Add content to the text file:
     - template contains requirements for the first four lines
     - additional lines are other files to be made into links
     - lines with x\yz or x/yz need ../../x/yz conversion
     - the -> separator allows custom text instead of defaulting to extension for links
     - adding the tag [direct] after a line containing a link will cause the main html to link directly to that file
  5) Run 'update.py' to generate new HTML files
