To create a new Entry:
  1) Browse to the category folder and run 'new.py'
  2) Add documents and datasheets to the containing folder
  8) Add content to the text file:
     - template contains requirements for the first four lines
     - additional lines are other files to be made into links
     - lines with x\yz or x/yz need ../../x/yz conversion
     - the -> separator allows custom text instead of defaulting to extension for links
  5) Run 'update.py' to generate new HTML files
